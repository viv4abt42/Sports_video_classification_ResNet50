# Sports video classification based on CNN tranfer models
The main goal is to find best algorithm which helps to classify five different types of sports from multiple videos. 
# Dataset: 
Dataset consists of sports frames captured from various videos with five different classrd of sports activities with more than 500
images per class.
# Models: 
I investigated various transfer learning models (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG19,VGG16) and evaluated performance of them. 
# Result:
ResNet50 outperforms other models with 88.97% of accuracy.
