# Sports video classification with ResNet50
The main goal is to find best algorithm which helps to classify five different types of sports from multiple videos. 
# Dataset: 
Dataset consists of sports frames captured from various videos with five different classrd of sports activities with more than 500
images per class.

I investigated various transfer learning models (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG19,VGG16) and evaluated performance of the models. 
# Result:
ResNet50 outperforms other models with 88.97% of accuracy.
